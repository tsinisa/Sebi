A 3D JavaScript tagcloud inspired by WP-Cumulus.


== Description ==

WP-Cirrus is a plugin that displays a 3D tag cloud in your WordPress. It can be
used as a widget or anywhere on your blog using the [wp-cirrus] code.

WP-Cirrus was inspired by the famous WP-Cumulus plugin. WP-Cirrus uses no Flash,
but only JavaScript and CSS to display the cloud. It gets all meta tags directly
from WordPress.

Our plugin makes no use of external libraries that have to be loaded with it at runtime
(e.g. jQuery or even Flash). This makes it very small and fast to load.

As it's still under development more releases will be seen in near future.

Have fun and tell us what you think about it.


== Installation ==

1. Unzip the plugin archive.
2. Create a folder `wp-cirrus` in your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Upload the files you just unzipped to this folder.
4. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
5. That's it. Now activate it through the widget settings or via the code (see FAQ).


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I use the tag cloud on my pages? =

Add the `[wp-cirrus]` code somewhere on the page to display it.

= I found a bug. What can I do? =

Please tell us! http://www.ga-ap.de/plugins/wp-cirrus/


== Screenshots ==
1. A big sample cloud - of course not animated. You'll be able to move it around with your mouse and select the tags.
2. A cloud with some animation. This is an animated GIF from an early version. The real cloud is much smoother. We had to keep the image small here.
